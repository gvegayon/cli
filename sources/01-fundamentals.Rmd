# Fundamentals

Here are some day to day operations related to navigating your computer and managing folders and files.

## Get help

The first, most important thing you should know is how to ask for help. Beyond googling--or [duckduckgoing](https://duckduckgo.com)--or looking for answers in [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), you should know that most commands have their own documentation which can be accessed using the `man` command, or, if available, calling the function with the `-h` flag. Here are two examples:

```bash
# Manual of the cd command
man cd

# Help of cd
cd -h
```

The former will take you to the manual, which could be rather long. In order to get out of there, you should type the `q` key on your keyboard. The latter will print some information in a much compact way, including the most important options.


## Location location location

The first thing you need to know is to be aware in which part of your system you are currently located at. For that, we use the `pwd` command

```{bash}
pwd
```

By itself, the `pwd` command will print-out the full path of your location, yet, if it happens that you accessed it through a [symbolic link](), it could be misleading. So, to avoid falling into error, add the `-P` flag (physical) to the end of the command, like `pwd -P`.

The second thing location-related you need to know is how to move to a particular location. To move around you have to use the `cd` command.

## Creating directories



## Moving, deleting, and renaming files
