# CLI Cheat Sheet

Knowing how to use the [**command-line interface (CLI)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) could be considered a fundamental ability to work in Data Science and related areas. As part of the class ["Introduction to Public Health Data Science"](https://github.com/USCbiostats/PM566) at USC, I created this repository including examples of--for the moment--basic CLI operations.
