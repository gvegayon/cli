# CLI Cheat Sheet

Knowing how to use the [**command-line interface (CLI)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) could be considered a fundamental ability to work in Data Science and related areas. As part of the class [**"Introduction to Public Health Data Science"**](https://github.com/USCbiostats/PM566) at USC, I created this repository including examples of--for the moment--basic CLI operations.

## Contents

1. Fundamentals ([link](01-fundamentals.md))

2. Git ([link](02-git.md))

3. R ([link](03-r.md))

4. Users and Groups ([link](04-users.md))


## Other CLI cheat sheets

Of course, this is not the first CLI cheat sheet, so here is a list of a couple of other projects I've found around:

- [Command Line Cheat Sheet: A command-line cheat sheet. (CLI is not a scary place!)](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CLI-Cheat-Sheet)
- [cheat.sh: the only cheat sheet you need](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh)
