# CLI Cheat Sheet

Knowing how to use the [**command-line interface (CLI)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) could be considered a fundamental ability to work in Data Science and related areas. As part of the class [**"Introduction to Public Health Data Science"**](https://github.com/USCbiostats/PM566) at USC, I created this repository including examples of--for the moment--basic CLI operations.

1. Fundamentals ([link](01-fundamentals.md))

## Other CLI cheat sheets

Of course this is not the first CLI cheat sheet, so here is a list of a couple of other projects I've found around:

- (Command Line Cheat Sheet: A command line cheat sheet. (CLI is not a scary place!))[https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CLI-Cheat-Sheet]
- (cheat.sh: the only cheat sheet you need)[https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh]
