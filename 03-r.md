# Using R in the console

Most of the time, you will be using R through an IDE as RStudio or
Jupyter Notebooks. Nonetheless, fancy point-and-click user interfaces
are not always available, especially when working with a cluster or a
remote server. In those cases, knowing how to use R in the command-line
becomes fundamental.

## Quick R calls

Many times, we don’t need to have a full script to execute, but rather a
single command that needs to be run. For example, RMarkdown files can be
compiled simply using the `rmarkdown::render()` function. For that and
other cases, we can use `Rscript` to run R on the fly. A couple of
examples:

1.  Using R as a calculator:

    ``` bash
    Rscript -e 'sqrt(pi + 100)'
    ```

        ## [1] 10.15586

2.  Render the RMarkdown document `/home/reports/report1.Rmd`:

    ``` bash
    Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("/home/reports/report1.Rmd")'
    ```

        ## 
        ## 
        ## processing file: report1.Rmd
        ##   |                                                                              |                                                                      |   0%  |                                                                              |......................................................................| 100%
        ##   ordinary text without R code
        ## 
        ## 
        ## output file: report1.knit.md
        ## 
        ## /usr/local/bin/pandoc +RTS -K512m -RTS report1.knit.md --to markdown_strict-yaml_metadata_block --from markdown+autolink_bare_uris+tex_math_single_backslash --output report1.md 
        ## 
        ## Output created: report1.md
        ## Warning message:
        ## In grSoftVersion() :
        ##   unable to load shared object '/usr/local/lib/R/modules//R_X11.so':
        ##   libXt.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Rscript is ideal to be used with bash scripts, for example, when
submitting a job to a cluster like Slurm. The bash file in that case
would be something like

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --name=My-R-job
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00

# If your Cluster works with modules
module load r

# Running the R script
Rscript /path/to/the/job.R
```

## Batch jobs

Long jobs can be run in
[batch-mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing), i.e.,
without you needing to be there. In that case, `R CMD BATCH` is the
right approach to follow. Here is an example:

We have an R script that will take a while to complete. So, instead of
initializing an R session or using some IDE, we could simple submit the
job using `R CMD BATCH`. Here is the R script we’d like to run:

``` bash
cat long-job.R
```

    ## library(MASS)
    ## for (i in 1:10) {
    ##   Sys.sleep(.5)
    ##   message("Step ", i)
    ## }
    ## message("Complete")

And this is how we execute it using `R CMD BATCH`.

``` bash
R CMD BATCH long-job.R long-job.Rout &
```

The first filename is the name–actually path–of the script to execute.
The second filename is log-file where R will print out the results.
Finally, the ampersand is to finalize the submittion, after which the
operating system will print the ID number of the process. Here are the
results:

``` bash
cat long-job.Rout
```
